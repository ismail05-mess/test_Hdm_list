# test_Hdm_list

Todo List Application
This project is a Todo List application that I worked on as part of a coding test. My task was to complete specific sections of the code where @todo comments were placed, in order to implement key functionalities such as task creation, deletion, and updating.



My Contributions
In this test, the project structure and basic functionality were already in place. My task was to implement the missing features in the sections marked with @todo. Below are the areas where I contributed:

1. Task Deletion (Backend & Frontend)
I implemented the functionality to delete tasks in both the backend and the frontend. On the frontend, I added the logic to call the API and refresh the task list after a task is deleted. In the backend, I set up the corresponding endpoint to handle the task deletion.

2. Task Creation (Backend & Frontend)
I added the logic to create a new task. On the frontend, this includes capturing the task name from an input field and sending it to the backend. On the backend, I implemented the logic to store the new task in the database.

3. Task Update (Backend & Frontend)
I completed the task update feature, which allows users to modify an existing task. On the frontend, I enabled the task editing mode and set up the "Save" button to update the task. On the backend, I handled the task update using the appropriate API method.

Challenges and Solutions
1. Understanding the Existing Codebase
Since the project structure was already set up, I took some time to familiarize myself with the code. This was important to ensure that my implementations fit well within the existing logic.

2. Handling API Calls in the Frontend
One of the challenges was ensuring that the frontend interacted properly with the backend API, especially for updating and deleting tasks. I researched the best practices for making API calls in React and applied this knowledge to complete the tasks.

3. Database Integration
I faced some issues with the MySQL setup initially, particularly with database connection errors. After troubleshooting and adjusting the .env file, I was able to resolve the issues and ensure the backend was properly connected to the database.
